        "\nA brief overview of VQE\n=======================\n\nThe Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) `[1, 2]<vqe_references>` is a flagship algorithm for\nquantum chemistry using near-term quantum computers. VQE is an application of the `Ritz variational\nprinciple <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritz_method>`_  where a quantum computer is used to \nprepare a wave function ansatz of the molecule and estimate the expectation value of its electronic\nHamiltonian while a classical optimizer is used to adjust the quantum circuit parameters in order \nto find the molecule's ground state energy.\n\nFor example, if we use a minimal basis, the ground state wave function of the hydrogen molecule \n$\\vert \\Psi \\rangle = \\alpha \\vert 1100 \\rangle + \\beta \\vert 0011 \\rangle$ consists of only\nthe Hartree-Fock component and a doubly-excited configuration where the two electrons occupy the \nhighest-energy molecular orbitals. If we use a quantum computer to prepare the four-qubit \nentangled state $\\vert \\Psi \\rangle$, the ultimate goal of the VQE algorithm \nis to find the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that minimize the expectation value of \nthe electronic Hamiltonian.\n \nThe PennyLane library allows users to implement the full VQE algorithm using only a few\nlines of code. In this tutorial, we guide you through a calculation of the ground-state energy of\nthe hydrogen molecule. Let's get started! \u269b\ufe0f\n\nBuilding the electronic Hamiltonian\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe first step is to import the required libraries and packages:\n"
